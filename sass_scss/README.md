# Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It helps you write maintainable, scalable, and powerful CSS with ease. Sass adds features like variables, nested rules, mixins, inheritance, and more, all of which make CSS more efficient and easier to write.
